# huffmanjs
A general purpose Huffman coding structure written in JavaScript


I just wanted to have fun with some data structures, and building a proper Huffman coding implementation
seemed fun. I want to be able to make this general purpose, but we'll see how it goes. 

I woud not advise using this in any serious project!
